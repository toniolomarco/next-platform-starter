    <h1>Adapting to AI and Automation in B2B SaaS Marketing</h1>
    <p>
      AI and automation are transforming B2B marketing. The best teams use these tools to work smarter-not just faster. Here’s how to get it right.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Use AI for Personalization and Scale</h2>
    <p>
      Tools like AdCreative.ai and Jasper help create personalized ads and content at scale. One SaaS client used Jasper templates to cut content production time by 60%<sup>[7]</sup>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Automate Repetitive Tasks, Not Relationships</h2>
    <p>
      Automate email follow-ups, lead scoring, and reporting, but keep human touch in demos and onboarding. Over-automating ABM campaigns cost a client 20% of their pipeline-lesson learned: balance is key.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Stay Ethical and Transparent</h2>
    <p>
      Disclose when AI is used in communications. Build trust by being upfront and using AI to enhance, not replace, your team’s expertise.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Regularly Review and Update Your Stack</h2>
    <p>
      The AI landscape evolves quickly. Review your tools quarterly and sunset those that no longer deliver value.
    </p>

    <h2>Personal Advice</h2>
    <p>
      Start with one workflow-like content creation or lead scoring-and automate it fully before expanding. Measure results and always keep the customer experience front and center.
