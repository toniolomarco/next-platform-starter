    <h1>Attribution Models That Actually Work for B2B SaaS</h1>
    <p>
      Proving marketing ROI in B2B SaaS is notoriously tough. With long sales cycles and multiple touchpoints, last-click attribution just doesn’t cut it. Here’s how leading SaaS marketers are getting a clearer picture-and how you can too.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Move Beyond Last-Click</h2>
    <p>
      Last-click attribution ignores the many steps a buyer takes. I’ve seen companies cut high-performing channels simply because they weren’t getting “credit.” One CRM SaaS client found that 70% of their most influential touchpoints were missed by last-click reporting<sup>[4]</sup>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Embrace Multi-Touch Attribution</h2>
    <p>
      Multi-touch models (linear, time decay, or custom weighted) better reflect the buyer journey. For example, a SaaS using HubSpot’s multi-touch model discovered that webinars and nurture emails played a bigger role in pipeline than paid search<sup>[2]</sup>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Integrate CRM and Marketing Data</h2>
    <p>
      Connect your CRM (like Salesforce or HubSpot) with your marketing automation platform. This lets you see which campaigns actually drive revenue, not just leads. One client increased marketing-sourced pipeline by 28% after integrating these systems and adjusting spend accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Use UTM Parameters and First-Party Data</h2>
    <p>
      UTM tracking, combined with first-party data, gives you granular insight. I recommend creating a simple dashboard to visualize the full customer journey.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Test and Refine</h2>
    <p>
      Attribution isn’t “set and forget.” Review your models quarterly and adjust for changes in your buyer’s journey or marketing mix.
    </p>

    <h2>Personal Advice</h2>
    <p>
      Don’t get overwhelmed by attribution complexity. Start simple: map your key touchpoints, connect your tools, and iterate. The goal is actionable insight, not perfection.
